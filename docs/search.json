My expertise lies in data cleaning, analysis, and building machine learning models to extract valuable insights from complex datasets, driving informed business decisions. Additionally, I’m adept at building robots for business process automation using UiPath, streamlining operations, and enhancing efficiency. With certifications in SAS and UiPath Advanced Developer, I am dedicated to staying at the cutting edge of technology. I’m passionate about leveraging data and automation to create innovative solutions that solve real-world challenges and contribute to business success.
