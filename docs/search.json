In my current job, my interviewers wanted to know the kind of work I have been doing before, and the only way I was able to show was to share my GitHub link which was a little difficult to navigate. I will create a website that is linked with my various GitHub projects whereby I will write summaries of the projects and include visualizations through markdown.\nPlan\nIdentify all the projects I have worked on this course and sort them based on the most successful or well-organized project.\nPublish the projects in my GitHub account.\nCreate a website using R markdown and find a suitable template available in GitHub pages.\nExtract links for all my major projects from GitHub.\nConnect each project to my portfolio.\nI plan to keep on updating it with new projects.\nType of portfolio\nAn interactive website built with R markdown.\n\n\n\n",
